# Summer program: Python basic - Search algorithm
##### The aim of this project is to let a high school student to get the basic knowledge of programming. Python is the best language for a starter to learn how to do programming.
##### The search algorithm is the most important algorithm in the computer science world. Imagine you have an English dictionary, how do you find the word in the dictionary?

## Learning Goals
1. Learn the basic concepts of programming, such as variable, if-else, loop, in and out.
2. Learn the basic data structures in Python, such as list and dict.
3. Learn the basic algorithm, such as search, and have the sense of algorithm efficiency.

## Expected Result
1. Write a function to find an element in an array, e.g., given an array [1 ,2 ,3, 4, 5], we want to find 4, then return the index of 4, which should be 3 (In the computer world, the indexs are always counted from 0).
2. Optimize the algorithm, to implement the binary search algorithm.
3. Output the efficiency on the screen, tell the time it spends to do linear search and binary search.

##### Please notice: a good programmer can know every thing when he/she has the Internet access, please go to search anything you want to know by Google.

## Timeline

#### Week1: Install the python IDE, learn the basic concepts about what is programming, how to run a programme.
#### Week2: Learn the basic concepts about data structures, and implement the linear search algorithm.
#### Week3: Learn the binary search algorithm, implement it.
#### Week4: Learn how to profile(time) the programme, how to output human-readable performance metrics.
